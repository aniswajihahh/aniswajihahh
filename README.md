# Hi, I'm Anis 👋

I am a final-year **Statistics Student** passionate about uncovering patterns in data. My goal is to bridge the gap between complex statistical methods and actionable business insights.

Currently, I am focusing on **Time Series Analysis**, **Statistical Modeling**, and **Data Visualization**.
