### My Projects

#### 1. [Logistic Regression Analysis of Factors Associated with Heart Failure](https://github.com/aniswajihahh/aniswajihahh/blob/main/LOGISTIC%20REGRESSION%20IN%20MEDICAL%20STUDIES.R)
*A statistical analysis to identify key risk factors contributing to heart failure.*
*   **Objective:** Determine which clinical variables (such as age, blood pressure, etc.) have the most significant impact on heart failure outcomes.
*   **Methodology:** Applied **Logistic Regression** to model the probability of heart failure & interpreted associations via Odds Ratios.
*   **Tools:** R, Statistical Modeling, Data Cleaning.

#### 2. [Electricity Consumption & Sector Analysis (Coming Soon)](LINK_TO_REPO_HERE)
*Analyzed Malaysia's electricity consumption trends to identify sector-based dependencies.*
*   **Methodology:** Applied **Granger Causality tests** and Time Series forecasting to determine predictive relationships.
*   **Key Finding:** Discovered a significant causal link between the "losses sector" and commercial energy consumption.
*   **Tools:** R, Power BI, Time Series Analysis.
